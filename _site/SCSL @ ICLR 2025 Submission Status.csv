In this work, we propose $DiffDiv$ an ensemble diversification framework exploiting Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DPMs) to mitigate this form of bias. We show that at particular training intervals, DPMs can generate images with novel feature combinations, even when trained on samples displaying correlated input features. We leverage this crucial property to generate synthetic counterfactuals to increase model diversity via ensemble disagreement. We show that DPM-guided diversification is sufficient to remove dependence on shortcut cues, without a need for additional supervised signals. We further empirically quantify its efficacy on several diversification objectives, and finally show improved generalization and diversification on par with prior work that relies on auxiliary data collection.","2","2","","6","7","6.50","4","4","4.00","0","0","","Accept",""

This work challenges this paradigm by introducing geometric masks—simple, human-perceptible overlays inspired by hCAPTCHA challenges—as a novel method for generating adversarial examples. Our contributions are threefold: (1) We demonstrate the limitations of the imperceptibility constraint and propose a broader conceptualization of adversarial examples. (2) We develop a computationally efficient framework for generating geometric masks, achieving high misclassification rates while maintaining semantic coherence. (3) Through extensive experiments on state-of-the-art vision models and an enriched ImageNet dataset, we highlight the effectiveness, transferability, and practicality of these masks in diverse applications, including CAPTCHA generation and content moderation. Our findings underscore the need to rethink adversarial robustness and provide a foundation for future research in unrestricted adversarial attacks.","2","2","","5","6","5.50","4","5","4.50","0","0","","Reject",""

Improving model robustness requires high-quality signals from robustness benchmarks to quantify progress. While various benchmark datasets such as ImageNet-C were proposed in the ImageNet era, most ImageNet-C corruption types are no longer OOD relative to today's large datasets scraped from the web, which already contain common corruptions such as blur or JPEG compression artifacts. Consequently, these standard benchmarks are no longer well-suited for evaluating OOD robustness in the era of web-scale datasets. Indeed, recent models show saturating scores on ImageNet-era OOD benchmarks, indicating that it is unclear whether models trained on web-scale datasets truly become better at OOD generalization or whether they have simply been exposed to the test distortions during training. To address this, we here introduce LAION-C as a benchmark alternative for ImageNet-C. LAION-C consists of six novel distortion types specifically designed to be OOD, even for web-scale datasets such as LAION. In a comprehensive evaluation of state-of-the-art models, we find that the LAION-C dataset poses significant challenges to contemporary models, including MLLMs such as Gemini and GPT-4o. We additionally conducted a psychophysical experiment to evaluate the difficulty of our proposed corruptions for human observers, enabling a comparison of models to lab-quality human robustness data. We observe a paradigm shift in OOD generalization: from humans outperforming models, to the best models now matching or outperforming the best human observers.","2","2","","6","7","6.50","4","4","4.00","0","0","","Accept",""

In this work, we provide a statistical characterization of this phenomenon for high-dimensional regression, when the data contains a predictive *core* feature $x$ and a *spurious* feature $y$. Specifically, we quantify the amount of spurious correlations $\mathcal C$ learned via linear regression, in terms of the data covariance and the strength $\lambda$ of the ridge regularization. As a consequence, we first capture the simplicity of $y$ through the spectrum of its covariance, and its correlation with $x$ through the Schur complement of the full data covariance. Next, we prove a trade-off between $\mathcal C$ and the in-distribution test loss $\mathcal L$, by showing that the value of $\lambda$ that minimizes $\mathcal L$ lies in an interval where $\mathcal C$ is increasing. Finally, we investigate the effects of over-parameterization via the random features model, by showing its equivalence to regularized linear regression.

By leveraging trajectory histories as instruments, we reformulate causal IL into Conditional Moment Restrictions (CMRs).

This problem becomes especially severe in high-stakes domains where the cost of relying on misaligned shortcuts is prohibitive. To address this challenge, concept bottlenecks explicitly factor predictions into high-level concepts and a simple decision layer, enabling experts to diagnose whether learned concepts align with their domain knowledge. Yet, simply removing undesirable concepts after training is insufficient to prevent shortcuts when the concept encoder is incomplete or entangled. In this work, we propose *CBDebug*, a novel framework to debug concept bottlenecks for robustness under subpopulation shift. First, a domain expert identifies and removes spurious concepts using model explanations (the *Removal* step). Then, leveraging this human feedback, we disentangle or replace the removed shortcuts by retraining on a rebalanced dataset based on the causal graph (the *Retraining* step). Empirically, *CBDebug* significantly outperforms existing concept-based methods. Overall, our work demonstrates how expert-guided debugging of concept bottlenecks can achieve interpretability and robustness, promoting alignment of a model’s internal reasoning with how humans reason.","2","2","","5","6","5.50","3","3","3.00","0","0","","Accept",""

The risks are amplified in real-world scenario when models are trained on limited and biased data.
In this work, we investigate the impact of spurious correlation bias on privacy vulnerability. 
We introduce _spurious privacy leakage_, a phenomenon where spurious groups are more vulnerable to privacy attacks compared to other groups.
Through empirical analysis, we counterintuitively demonstrate that reducing spurious correlation fails to address the privacy disparity between groups.
This leads us to introduce a new perspective on privacy disparity based on data memorization. We show that mitigating spurious correlation does not reduce the degree of data memorization, and therefore, neither the privacy risks.

"8","https://openreview.net/forum?id=PxyFJfsxtR","ReSL: Enhancing Deep Clustering Through Reset-based Self-Labeling","The goal of clustering is to group similar data points together. Deep clustering enhances this process by using neural networks for inferring better data representations through a three-stage approach: pre-training for initial feature learning, deep clustering to structure the latent space, and self-labeling to iteratively refine both representations and cluster assignments. Ever since its inception, self-labeling has been a crucial element for reaching state-of-the-art performance in deep clustering. The samples for the self-labeling phase are obtained by setting a confidence threshold for the network’s predictions and only using samples that exceed this threshold for further training. This often improves clustering performance but relies on training with noisy, self-constructed labels (pseudo-labels). As the model iteratively retrains on its own pseudo-labels, the certainty of its predictions tends to rise, increasing its confidence over time. The increasing confidence leads to a growing number of training samples also including more and more samples assigned to the wrong cluster, which can limit performance. Particularly, the model's initially learned biases are amplified by relying on easily learned but ultimately misleading patterns in pseudo-labels, hampering generalization.

In this paper, we propose ReSL, a framework that unites Resets with Self-Labeling. We demonstrate that employing weight-reset techniques during self-labeling increases clustering performance and improves generalization. Our findings address limitations of self-labeling and provide a foundation for future research in developing more robust approaches.","2","2","","6","6","6.00","3","4","3.50","0","0","","Accept",""

Recent work proposes Set-Based Prompting (SBP) as a way to remove order information from designated token subsets, thereby mitigating positional biases. However, applying SBP on base models induces an out-of-distribution input format, which can degrade in-distribution performance. We introduce a fine-tuning strategy that integrates SBP into the training process, “pulling” these set-formatted prompts closer to the model’s training manifold. We show that SBP can be incorporated into a model via fine-tuning. Our experiments on in-distribution (MMLU) and out-of-distribution (CSQA, ARC Challenge) multiple-choice tasks show that SBP fine-tuning significantly improves accuracy and robustness to answer-order permutations, all while preserving broader language modeling capabilities.

In this work, we employ causal reasoning and careful consideration for task-discriminative artifacts in various EEG datasets covering diverse BCI paradigms and propose a benchmarking protocol to properly evaluate the decoding performance and generalization capabilities of LBMs. Utilising a subject-independent cross-validation approach for each curated benchmark dataset, we showcase that LBMs achieve marginal performance gains over conventional deep learning baselines.","2","2","","4","6","5.00","4","4","4.00","0","0","","Accept",""

This approach extracts and reuses residual information from imperfect smoothing, mitigating loss of representation capacity.

In this work, we investigate the layer-wise impact of image shortcuts on learned features. First, we propose an experiment design that introduces artificial shortcut-inducing skews during training, enabling a counterfactual analysis of how different layers contribute to shortcut-related accuracy degradation. Next, we use our method to study the effects of a patch-like skew on CNNs trained on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100. Our analysis reveals that different types of skews affect networks layers differently: class-universal skews (affecting all instances of a target class) and class-specific skews (affecting only one class) impact deeper layers more than non-universal and non-specific skews, respectively. Additionally, we identify the forgetting of shortcut-free features as a key mechanism behind accuracy drop for our class of skews, indicating the potential role of simplicity bias (Shah et al., 2020) and excessive regularization (Sagawa et al., 2020) in shortcut learning.","2","2","","4","5","4.50","3","4","3.50","0","0","","Accept",""

Often, this requires a far-sighted, creative leap of thought. We argue that this requirement is misaligned with the objective of next-token prediction (NTP). To formulate our intuition, we design a suite of minimal algorithmic tasks loosely based on real-world creative endeavors. Concretely, our tasks require an open-ended _stochastic_ planning step that (a) discovers new connections in a knowledge graph (loosely inspired by word-play, humor or drawing analogies) or (b) constructs new patterns (loosely inspired by constructing word problems, puzzles or mysteries).
 We then conceptually and empirically argue how NTP leads to myopic shortcut-learning and excessive memorization, limiting its ability to generate novel solutions. In contrast, we find that multi-token approaches, namely teacherless training and diffusion models, can overcome these limitations and comparatively excel on our algorithmic test-bed. Orthogonally, we find that creativity in our tasks is greatly improved by training with a random hash prefix (which we dub as ``_{hash-conditioning_'').
 Thus our work offers a principled, minimal test-bed for studying  open-ended forms of intelligence and also  a new angle to take a more serious interest in the paradigm of multi-token prediction.","2","2","","3","8","5.50","4","4","4.00","0","0","","Accept",""

We design a compositional algorithmic task based on the modular exponential---a double exponential task composed of two single exponential subtasks---and train transformer models to learn the task in-context. We compare the model when trained (a) using an in-context curriculum consisting of single exponential subtasks and, (b) the model trained directly on the double exponential task without such a curriculum. We show that the model trained with a subtask curriculum can perform zero-shot inference on unseen compositional tasks and is more robust given the same context length. We study how the task is represented across the two training regimes, in particular whether subtask information is represented.

This phenomenon is prevalent across various machine learning applications, including vision, natural language processing, and speech recognition, where models may find unintended cues that minimize training loss but fail to capture the underlying structure of the data. Vision classifiers based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs), and Vision Transformers (ViTs) leverage distinct architectural principles to process spatial and structural information, making them differently susceptible to shortcut learning. In this study, we systematically evaluate these architectures by introducing deliberate shortcuts into the dataset that are positionally correlated with class labels, creating a controlled setup to assess whether models rely on these artificial cues or learn actual distinguishing features. We perform both quantitative evaluation by training on the shortcut-modified dataset and testing them on two different test sets—one containing the same shortcuts and another without them—to determine the extent of reliance on shortcuts. Additionally, qualitative evaluation is performed by using network inversion-based reconstruction techniques to analyze what the models internalize in their weights, aiming to reconstruct the training data as perceived by the classifiers. Further we also evaluate susceptibility to shortcuts learning across different learning rates. Our analysis reveals that CNNs at lower learning rates comparatively tend to be reserved against entirely picking up the shortcut features while ViTs almost entirely ignore the distinctive image features in presence of shortcuts.","2","1","~Mahdi_Ghaznavi1","6","6","6.00","4","4","4.00","0","0","","Accept",""

This paper introduces a novel graph-theoretic framework to analyze position bias in multi-layer attention. Modeling attention masks as directed graphs, we quantify how tokens interact with contextual information based on their sequential positions. We uncover two key insights: First, causal masking inherently biases attention toward earlier positions, as tokens in deeper layers attend to increasingly more contextualized representations of earlier tokens. Second, we characterize the competing effects of the causal mask and relative positional encodings, such as the decay mask and rotary positional encoding (RoPE): while both mechanisms introduce distance-based decay within individual attention maps, their aggregate effect across multiple attention layers – coupled with the causal mask – leads to a trade-off between the long-term decay effects and the cumulative importance of early sequence positions. Through controlled numerical experiments, we not only validate our theoretical findings but also reproduce position biases observed in real-world LLMs. Our framework offers a principled foundation for understanding positional biases in transformers, shedding light on the complex interplay of attention mechanism components and guiding more informed architectural design.","2","2","","6","7","6.50","1","3","2.00","0","0","","Accept",""

Differently, we adopt a more conservative perspective by accounting for the worst-case error across all sufficiently diverse test distributions within a known domain. Our first finding is that training on a uniform distribution over this domain is optimal. We also interrogate practical remedies when uniform samples are unavailable by considering methods for mitigating non-uniformity through finetuning and rebalancing.

While these classifiers serve important functions, it is also essential that they are built in ways that minimize unfair biases for users. One such fairness consideration is called group fairness, which desires that different sub-population of users receive equal treatment.  This is a well-studied problem in the context of classical classifiers. However, the emergence of prompt-based language model (LM) decision making has created new opportunities to solve text-based classification tasks, and the fairness properties of these new classifiers are not yet well understood. Further, the remediation toolkit is incomplete for LM-based decision makers and little is understood about how to improve decision maker group fairness while maintaining classifier performance. This work sets out to add more tools to that toolbox. We introduce adaptations of existing effective approaches from the classical classifier fairness to the prompt-based classifier space. We also devise simple methods that take advantage of the new structure of prompt-based decision makers and operate at the prompt level. We compare these approaches empirically on real data. Our results suggest that adaptations of approaches that are effective for classical classifiers remain effective in the LM-based classifier environment.

While causal discovery methods exist to infer causal structure from data, many are computationally expensive and non-differentiable, limiting their integration into modern AI systems. In this work, we introduce a differentiable approach to causal ordering that allows causal discovery to be seamlessly incorporated as a module within existing machine learning pipelines. Our method builds upon Intersort (Chevalley et al., 2025), a score-based algorithm for discovering causal order in Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) using interventional data. To enable differentiable optimization, we develop a continuous relaxation of Intersort using differentiable sorting and ranking techniques, allowing causal constraints to be directly integrated into gradient-based learning frameworks.

Surprisingly, LLR has recently been found to improve worst-group accuracy even when the held-out set is an imbalanced subset of the training set. We initially hypothesize that this “unreasonable effectiveness” of LLR is explained by its ability to mitigate neural collapse through the held-out set, resulting in the implicit bias of gradient descent benefiting robustness. Our empirical investigation does not support this hypothesis. Instead, we present strong evidence for an alternative hypothesis: that the success of LLR is primarily due to better group balance in the held-out set. We conclude by showing how the recent algorithms CB-LLR and AFR perform implicit group-balancing to elicit a robustness improvement.","2","2","","4","4","4.00","4","5","4.50","0","0","","Accept",""

However, the generated videos often contain factual inaccuracies and lack understanding of fundamental physical laws.

Unlike classification, the robustness of object detection models has received relatively limited attention, with most existing work focusing on adapting adversarial training. In this paper, we take a different approach, leveraging classification-based robust models to enhance the robustness of object detection.

To address this issue, we propose efficient modifications to the robust backbone, enabling adversarial robustness with standard training. Additionally, we introduce a theoretically grounded, efficient two-phase training strategy that achieves state-of-the-art robustness.

Our approach achieves state-of-the-art robustness and significantly improves efficiency compared to traditional adversarial training methods.

Our experiments on datasets with background spurious correlations suggest that even in this task OCL representations do not lead to better generalization than object-centric representations provided by foundational segmentation models. These results showcase the importance of recognizing advances in zero-shot image segmentation when high-performant object-centric representations are the end goal. In addition to that, we suggest exploring new benchmarks for OCL methods evaluation that better reflect the problems these methods are designed to solve and highlight scenarios where OCL methods are more favorable solutions than foundational segmentation models.","2","2","","3","6","4.50","3","4","3.50","0","0","","Accept",""

Using the dependencies between instances, CICM-ViT dynamically masks spectral patches across instances, promoting the learning of discriminative features while reducing redundancy, especially in low-data settings. This approach reduces shortcut learning by focusing on global patterns rather than relying on local spurious correlations. CICM-ViT achieves state-of-the-art performance on HSI datasets, with 99.91% OA on Salinas, 96.88% OA on Indian Pines, and 98.88% OA on Botswana, outperforming fourteen SOTA CNN- and transformer-based approaches in both accuracy and efficiency, with only 89,680 parameters.","2","2","","5","9","7.00","2","4","3.00","0","0","","Accept",""

To mitigate this over-reliance, Deep Feature Reweighting (DFR) has emerged as an efficient approach, which works by retraining the last layer of an ERM model on a small reweighting dataset. While effective, DFR requires group annotations to create the reweighting dataset, which may be challenging and costly to obtain. Though subsequent works have proposed ways to alleviate this constraint, existing methods still largely rely on group annotations for hyperparameter tuning to achieve robust performance. In this paper, we present LACER, a method that improves group robustness without requiring explicit group annotations for either training or model selection. LACER operates in two stages: first estimating group labels through a loss-weighted clustering formulation that effectively identifies clusters corresponding to underrepresented groups in the validation set, then leveraging these estimated labels for last-layer retraining. Our results provide the empirical evidence that combining semantic feature information with loss values enables effective group label estimation. We validate LACER across multiple vision spurious correlations benchmarks, demonstrating performance comparable to oracle last-layer retraining methods that utilize ground-truth group annotations.","2","2","","6","6","6.00","4","4","4.00","0","0","","Accept",""

We investigate whether neural networks express representations as linear sums of simpler constituent parts.  Our analysis reveals that models trained from scratch often exhibit decodability, where the features can be linearly decoded to perform well, but may lack linear structure, preventing the models from generalizing zero-shot. Instead, linearity of representations only arises with high training data diversity. We prove that when representations are linear, perfect generalization to novel concept combinations is possible with minimal training data. Empirically evaluating large-scale pretrained models through this lens reveals that they achieve strong generalization for certain concept types while still falling short of the ideal linear structure for others.","2","2","","6","8","7.00","3","4","3.50","0","0","","Accept",""

Object-Centric representation learning has been proposed as a promising approach for achieving this capability. However, systematic evaluation of these methods in visually complex settings remains limited. In this work, we introduce a benchmark to measure how well vision encoders, with and without object-centric biases, generalize to unseen combinations of object properties. Using CLEVRTex-style images, we create multiple training splits with partial coverage of object property combinations and generate question--answer pairs to assess compositional generalization on a held-out test set.
We focus on comparing pretrained foundation models with object-centric models that incorporate such foundation models as backbones---a leading approach in this domain. To ensure a fair and comprehensive comparison, we carefully account for representation format differences. In this preliminary study, we use DINOv2 as the foundation model and DINOSAURv2 as its object-centric counterpart. We control for compute budget and differences in image representation sizes to ensure robustness.
Our key findings reveal that object-centric approaches (1) converge faster on in-distribution data but underperform slightly when non-object-centric models are given a significant compute advantage, and (2) they exhibit superior compositional generalization, outperforming DINOv2 on unseen combinations of object properties while requiring approximately four to eight times less downstream compute.","2","2","","3","4","3.50","3","4","3.50","0","0","","Accept",""

This bias can result in models making skewed predictions with poor out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization. To address this issue, we propose three techniques to mitigate simplicity bias. One of these is a modification to the Feature Sieve method. In the second method we utilize neuronal correlations as a penalizing effect to try and enforce the learning of different features. The third technique involves a novel feature-building approach called Self-Supervised Augmentation. We validate our methods' generalization capabilities through experiments on a custom dataset.","2","2","","4","6","5.00","3","4","3.50","0","0","","Accept",""

To address this challenge, we innovatively interpret multimodal ICL from the perspective of task mapping. We systematically model local and global relationships within in-context demonstrations (ICDs) and demonstrate their core role and cohesion in enhancing LVLM performance. Inspired by these findings, we propose Ta-ICL, a lightweight transformer-based model equipped with task-aware attention to dynamically configure ICL sequences. By integrating task mapping into the autoregressive process, Ta-ICL achieves bidirectional enhancement between sequence configuration and task reasoning. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that Ta-ICL effectively improves multimodal ICL across various LVLMs and tasks. Our results highlight the potential of task mapping to be widely applied in enhancing multimodal reasoning, paving the way for robust and generalizable multimodal ICL frameworks.","2","2","","4","6","5.00","3","3","3.00","0","0","","Accept","Fahimeh Hosseini Noohdani"

However, these models often encode hidden biases due to feature correlations, leading to systemic discrimination. Existing fairness interventions, such as adversarial debiasing and reweighting, struggle to generalize across domains and fail to mitigate dynamically emerging biases.

We introduce FairDNN, a Reinforcement Learning (RL)-based deep neural network that integrates fairness-aware reward mechanisms during training. Unlike traditional fairness interventions, FairDNN dynamically optimizes fairness through a fairness-adjusted loss function while maintaining predictive accuracy. Our approach introduces an exploration-based fairness regularization strategy and sequential fairness tracking, ensuring that bias is mitigated at multiple levels of the model pipeline. We further evaluate Intersectional Fairness, analyzing bias impact across demographic subgroups. Our experiments compare FairDNN against Logistic Regression and XGBoost with fairness constraints, demonstrating superior fairness mitigation with minimal accuracy trade-offs.","2","2","","3","3","3.00","4","5","4.50","0","0","","Reject",""
"68","https://openreview.net/forum?id=EqAxMjnz3X","On The Role of Batch Size in Group Robustness: A Training Dynamical Study","Group robustness in machine learning is often challenged by the presence of spurious correlations, which cause models to rely on non-causal features, leading to poor generalization for underrepresented groups. Deep learning models trained with stochastic gradient descent (SGD) rely on spurious patterns instead of core patterns that determine the label due to simplicity bias. While some previous studies have examined SGD biases to explain this reliance, it is not well understood what properties of SGD algorithms cause such biases. We investigate the role of batch size in reliance on spurious correlations by showing that smaller batch sizes can lead to significantly higher worst-group accuracies. We analyze the alignment of gradients for data from different groups separately and observe that this phenomenon is not only rooted in the increased variance of smaller batch sizes but also in the biased estimation of the optimization direction by majority groups, which allows minority samples to influence the training trajectory. Our observations could contribute to a deeper understanding of SGD bias and its relation to group robustness.","2","2","","2","5","3.50","4","5","4.50","0","0","","Reject","Hesam Asadollahzadeh"
