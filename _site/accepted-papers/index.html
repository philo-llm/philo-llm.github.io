        <div class="paper-title" data-abstract="Out-of-distribution (OOD) robustness is a desired property of computer vision models. Improving model robustness requires high-quality signals from robustness benchmarks to quantify progress. While various benchmark datasets such as ImageNet-C were proposed in the ImageNet era, most ImageNet-C corruption types are no longer OOD relative to today's large datasets scraped from the web, which already contain common corruptions such as blur or JPEG compression artifacts. Consequently, these standard benchmarks are no longer well-suited for evaluating OOD robustness in the era of web-scale datasets. Indeed, recent models show saturating scores on ImageNet-era OOD benchmarks, indicating that it is unclear whether models trained on web-scale datasets truly become better at OOD generalization or whether they have simply been exposed to the test distortions during training. To address this, we here introduce LAION-C as a benchmark alternative for ImageNet-C. LAION-C consists of six novel distortion types specifically designed to be OOD, even for web-scale datasets such as LAION. In a comprehensive evaluation of state-of-the-art models, we find that the LAION-C dataset poses significant challenges to contemporary models, including MLLMs such as Gemini and GPT-4o. We additionally conducted a psychophysical experiment to evaluate the difficulty of our proposed corruptions for human observers, enabling a comparison of models to lab-quality human robustness data. We observe a paradigm shift in OOD generalization: from humans outperforming models, to the best models now matching or outperforming the best human observers.">

        <div class="paper-title" data-abstract="Learning models have been shown to rely on spurious correlations between non-predictive features and the associated labels in the training data, with negative implications on robustness, bias and fairness.
In this work, we provide a statistical characterization of this phenomenon for high-dimensional regression, when the data contains a predictive *core* feature $x$ and a *spurious* feature $y$. Specifically, we quantify the amount of spurious correlations $\mathcal C$ learned via linear regression, in terms of the data covariance and the strength $\lambda$ of the ridge regularization. As a consequence, we first capture the simplicity of $y$ through the spectrum of its covariance, and its correlation with $x$ through the Schur complement of the full data covariance. Next, we prove a trade-off between $\mathcal C$ and the in-distribution test loss $\mathcal L$, by showing that the value of $\lambda$ that minimizes $\mathcal L$ lies in an interval where $\mathcal C$ is increasing. Finally, we investigate the effects of over-parameterization via the random features model, by showing its equivalence to regularized linear regression.
Our theoretical results are supported by numerical experiments on Gaussian, Color-MNIST, and CIFAR-10 datasets.">

        <div class="paper-title" data-abstract="Machine learning models often learn unintended shortcuts (spurious correlations) that do not reflect the true causal structure of a task and thus degrade dramatically under subpopulation shift. This problem becomes especially severe in high-stakes domains where the cost of relying on misaligned shortcuts is prohibitive. To address this challenge, concept bottlenecks explicitly factor predictions into high-level concepts and a simple decision layer, enabling experts to diagnose whether learned concepts align with their domain knowledge. Yet, simply removing undesirable concepts after training is insufficient to prevent shortcuts when the concept encoder is incomplete or entangled. In this work, we propose *CBDebug*, a novel framework to debug concept bottlenecks for robustness under subpopulation shift. First, a domain expert identifies and removes spurious concepts using model explanations (the *Removal* step). Then, leveraging this human feedback, we disentangle or replace the removed shortcuts by retraining on a rebalanced dataset based on the causal graph (the *Retraining* step). Empirically, *CBDebug* significantly outperforms existing concept-based methods. Overall, our work demonstrates how expert-guided debugging of concept bottlenecks can achieve interpretability and robustness, promoting alignment of a model’s internal reasoning with how humans reason.">

The risks are amplified in real-world scenario when models are trained on limited and biased data.
In this work, we investigate the impact of spurious correlation bias on privacy vulnerability. 
We introduce _spurious privacy leakage_, a phenomenon where spurious groups are more vulnerable to privacy attacks compared to other groups.
Through empirical analysis, we counterintuitively demonstrate that reducing spurious correlation fails to address the privacy disparity between groups.
This leads us to introduce a new perspective on privacy disparity based on data memorization. We show that mitigating spurious correlation does not reduce the degree of data memorization, and therefore, neither the privacy risks.

        <div class="paper-title" data-abstract="The goal of clustering is to group similar data points together. Deep clustering enhances this process by using neural networks for inferring better data representations through a three-stage approach: pre-training for initial feature learning, deep clustering to structure the latent space, and self-labeling to iteratively refine both representations and cluster assignments. Ever since its inception, self-labeling has been a crucial element for reaching state-of-the-art performance in deep clustering. The samples for the self-labeling phase are obtained by setting a confidence threshold for the network’s predictions and only using samples that exceed this threshold for further training. This often improves clustering performance but relies on training with noisy, self-constructed labels (pseudo-labels). As the model iteratively retrains on its own pseudo-labels, the certainty of its predictions tends to rise, increasing its confidence over time. The increasing confidence leads to a growing number of training samples also including more and more samples assigned to the wrong cluster, which can limit performance. Particularly, the model's initially learned biases are amplified by relying on easily learned but ultimately misleading patterns in pseudo-labels, hampering generalization.

In this paper, we propose ReSL, a framework that unites Resets with Self-Labeling. We demonstrate that employing weight-reset techniques during self-labeling increases clustering performance and improves generalization.

However, applying SBP on base models induces an out-of-distribution input format, which can degrade in-distribution performance. We introduce a fine-tuning strategy that integrates SBP into the training process, “pulling” these set-formatted prompts closer to the model’s training manifold. We show that SBP can be incorporated into a model via fine-tuning. Our experiments on in-distribution (MMLU) and out-of-distribution (CSQA, ARC Challenge) multiple-choice tasks show that SBP fine-tuning significantly improves accuracy and robustness to answer-order permutations, all while preserving broader language modeling capabilities.

We propose Deconfounded Empirical Risk Minimization (DERM), a new simple learning procedure minimizing the risk over a fictitious target population, preventing potential confounding effects. We validate our method on both synthetic and real-world scientific data. Notably, for the first time, we zero-shot generalize causal inferences on ISTAnt dataset (without annotation) by causal lifting a predictive model on our experiment variant.</div>

This paper introduces Bias-Resilient Preference Optimization (BRPO), a novel framework that addresses multiple sources of content-dependent bias in preference learning. BRPO employs a multi-objective optimization approach to separate true preferences from biases, effectively mitigating their impact. We leverage backdoor attack mechanisms to efficiently learn and control for various biases within a single model. Theoretical analysis and extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that BRPO significantly improves alignment with primary human preferences while controlling for secondary biases such as response length and harmfulness.</div>

        <div class="paper-abstract">This article presents a novel Cross-Instance Contrastive Masking-Enhanced Vision Transformer (CICM-ViT) for hyperspectral image (HSI) classification, which attempts to reduce shortcut learning through Cross-Instance Contrastive Masking (CICM) to enhance spectral-spatial feature extraction through self-supervision. Using the dependencies between instances, CICM-ViT dynamically masks spectral patches across instances, promoting the learning of discriminative features while reducing redundancy, especially in low-data settings.

        <div class="paper-title" data-abstract="Deep neural networks trained with Empirical Risk Minimization (ERM) are prone to rely on simple spurious features—features that are correlated with the target but are not causally related to it. To mitigate this over-reliance, Deep Feature Reweighting (DFR) has emerged as an efficient approach, which works by retraining the last layer of an ERM model on a small reweighting dataset. While effective, DFR requires group annotations to create the reweighting dataset, which may be challenging and costly to obtain. Though subsequent works have proposed ways to alleviate this constraint, existing methods still largely rely on group annotations for hyperparameter tuning to achieve robust performance. In this paper, we present LACER, a method that improves group robustness without requiring explicit group annotations for either training or model selection. LACER operates in two stages: first estimating group labels through a loss-weighted clustering formulation that effectively identifies clusters corresponding to underrepresented groups in the validation set, then leveraging these estimated labels for last-layer retraining. Our results provide the empirical evidence that combining semantic feature information with loss values enables effective group label estimation. We validate LACER across multiple vision spurious correlations benchmarks, demonstrating performance comparable to oracle last-layer retraining methods that utilize ground-truth group annotations.">

        <div class="paper-title" data-abstract="Compositional generalization—the ability to reason about novel combinations of familiar concepts—is fundamental to human cognition and a critical challenge for machine learning. Object-Centric representation learning has been proposed as a promising approach for achieving this capability. However, systematic evaluation of these methods in visually complex settings remains limited. In this work, we introduce a benchmark to measure how well vision encoders, with and without object-centric biases, generalize to unseen combinations of object properties. Using CLEVRTex-style images, we create multiple training splits with partial coverage of object property combinations and generate question--answer pairs to assess compositional generalization on a held-out test set.
We focus on comparing pretrained foundation models with object-centric models that incorporate such foundation models as backbones---a leading approach in this domain. To ensure a fair and comprehensive comparison, we carefully account for representation format differences. In this preliminary study, we use DINOv2 as the foundation model and DINOSAURv2 as its object-centric counterpart. We control for compute budget and differences in image representation sizes to ensure robustness.
Our key findings reveal that object-centric approaches (1) converge faster on in-distribution data but underperform slightly when non-object-centric models are given a significant compute advantage, and (2) they exhibit superior compositional generalization, outperforming DINOv2 on unseen combinations of object properties while requiring approximately four to eight times less downstream compute.">
