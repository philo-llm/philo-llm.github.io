## About

This repository hosts the website for the NeurIPS 2025 Workshop on "Philosophy of AI in the Era of Large Language Models". The workshop brings together researchers from philosophy, computer science, cognitive science, and related fields to examine the conceptual, methodological, and normative challenges posed by large language models.

Recent advances in LLMs raise pressing questions that intersect with longstanding debates in philosophy, cognitive science, and AI safety. As these systems increasingly exhibit behaviors associated with reasoning, communication, and decision-making, they compel a reexamination of foundational concepts such as knowledge, intentionality, agency, and consciousness.
