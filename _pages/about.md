## Workshop Introduction

Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) raise pressing conceptual and practical questions that intersect with longstanding debates in philosophy, cognitive science, and AI safety. As these systems increasingly exhibit behaviors associated with reasoning, communication, and decision-making, they compel a reexamination of foundational concepts such as knowledge, intentionality, agency, and consciousness—ideas once thought unique to biological minds.

At the same time, LLMs open new avenues for studying cognition from the outside in: as *in silico* model organisms, they enable controlled investigations into learning, abstraction, and generalization as things-in-themselves. This workshop will bring together a diverse group of participants from philosophy, computer science, cognitive science, political theory, and related fields to foster rigorous interdisciplinary dialogue on how LLMs inform our understanding of intelligence—both artificial and natural—and how their development and deployment reshape societal, epistemic, and normative frameworks.
