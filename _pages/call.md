## Call for Papers

We invite contributions from philosophy, machine learning, cognitive science, and related disciplines that critically examine the conceptual, methodological, and normative challenges posed by large language models. Particular emphasis is placed on foundational philosophical issues, especially those arising in epistemology and the philosophy of science, the philosophy of language, and the philosophy of mind.

## Topics of Interest

Topics include, but are not limited to, the following:

### Philosophy of Science: Rethinking Explanation, Evidence, and Theory
What counts as evidence when studying non-biological agents? Can traditional notions of theory, representation, or mechanism apply to opaque statistical systems? Should we adopt new epistemological tools tailored to non-human, computational agents? Or must we reconceptualize existing terms to avoid anthropocentric bias while preserving explanatory rigor?

### Philosophy of Mind: Using LLMs as *In Silico* Cognitive Organisms
How can their behavior inform theories of mental representation, learning, or inference? What does their success or failure tell us about the structure of mind? Where do analogies to human cognition hold, and where do they fail?

### Learning and Development: Revisiting the Nativist–Empiricist Debate
Is scaling alone sufficient for general intelligence? To what extent are new forms of structure, prior knowledge, or inductive bias needed? What does the study of human development and learning tell us about architectural limitations or cognitive gaps in current systems?

### Philosophy of Language: Meaning, Grounding, and Semantic Competence
Can models trained purely on form possess conceptual content? How do foundational issues like the symbol-grounding problem or the distinction between syntax and semantics apply to these systems?

### Intentionality: Mental Content and Representation in Disembodied Systems
Can we meaningfully ascribe intentional states—like beliefs or desires—to LLMs? How should classical theories of intentionality apply here, and what would justify treating their internal representations as genuinely content-bearing?

### Consciousness: Theoretical Possibilities for Synthetic Phenomenology
Can LLMs exhibit consciousness in any form? Which theories of consciousness are relevant to their architecture? How might we operationalize tests for awareness, and what empirical signatures would count as evidence?

### Ethics and Political Philosophy: Agency, Moral Responsibility, and Accountability
How can we determine whether LLMs should be considered moral agents and/or patients? What ethical frameworks can accommodate distributed agency in complex AI systems, and what implications might these have for broader normative theory as well as for guiding policy and governance decisions?

## Submission Guidelines

### Types of Submissions
We welcome both theoretical and empirical submissions. Theoretical papers should demonstrate strong philosophical merit, while empirical papers must clearly articulate implications for philosophical issues.
