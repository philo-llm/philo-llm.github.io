        <div class="speaker-bio">
          <p>David Chalmers is University Professor of Philosophy and Neural Science and co-director of the Center for Mind, Brain, and Consciousness at New York University. He is the author of <em>The Conscious Mind</em> (1996), <em>Constructing The World</em> (2010), and <em>Reality+: Virtual Worlds and the Problems of Philosophy</em> (2022). He is known for formulating the "hard problem" of consciousness, which inspired Tom Stoppard's play <em>The Hard Problem</em>, and for the idea of the "extended mind," which says that the tools we use can become parts of our minds. He is widely regarded as one of the most important living philosophers, whose work has transformative impact on numerous disciplines, including the development of artificial intelligence.</p>
