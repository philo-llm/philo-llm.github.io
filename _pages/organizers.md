Cameron Buckner is a Professor and the Donald F. Cronin Chair in the Humanities at the University of Florida. His research primarily concerns philosophical issues which arise in the study of non-human minds, especially animal cognition and artificial intelligence. He received a PhD in Philosophy at Indiana University in 2011 and an Alexander von Humboldt Postdoctoral Fellowship at Ruhr-University Bochum from 2011 to 2013. In his recent book "From Deep Learning to Rational Machines" (2024, OUP), he uses empiricist philosophy of mind to understand recent advances in deep-neural-network-based artificial intelligence.

## Program Committee

The Program Committee brings together philosophers and AI/ML researchers from academia, industry, and leading research institutions. We have made a deliberate effort to assemble a committee that reflects diversity not only in academic discipline and research methodology, but also in career stage, institutional affiliation, geographic region, and personal identity—ensuring a rich and representative set of perspectives.

**Confirmed Program Committee chairs:** Kola Ayonrinde, Leonard Dung, Ben Henke, Gualtiero Piccinini, Renee Ye

*The complete Program Committee list with over 100 members will be updated on our website.*
