</div>

Martin Ziqiao Ma is a Ph.D. candidate at the University of Michigan. His research stands on the intersection of language, interaction, and embodiment from a cognitive perspective, with the goal of grounding and aligning language agents to non-linguistic modalities and rich interactive contexts. He is a recipient of the Weinberg Cognitive Science Fellowship, an Outstanding Paper Award at ACL 2023, and the Amazon Alexa Prize Simbot Challenge Award.

## Program Committee

The Program Committee brings together philosophers and AI/ML researchers from academia, industry, and leading research institutions. We have made a deliberate effort to assemble a committee that reflects diversity not only in academic discipline and research methodology, but also in career stage, institutional affiliation, geographic region, and personal identity—ensuring a rich and representative set of perspectives.

**Confirmed Program Committee chairs:** Kola Ayonrinde, Leonard Dung, Ben Henke, Gualtiero Piccinini, Renee Ye

*The complete Program Committee list with over 100 members will be updated on our website.*
